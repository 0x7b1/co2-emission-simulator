	abstract = {{CO}2 emissions caused by private motorized trafﬁc for the city of Graz, a typical European inland city with about 320 000 citizens, are investigated. The main methodology is a newly developed agent-based model that incorporates empirical data about the mobility behavior of the citizens in order to calculate the traveled routes, the resulting trafﬁc and subsequent emissions. To assess the impact of different policies on {CO}2 emissions, different scenarios are simulated and their results are compared to a base line scenario. The model features a local and temporal resolution, effects like congestion and stop-and-go trafﬁc as well as commuters to and from other regions. In addition to the evaluation of certain policies (like a focus on electric cars, telecommuting or an improvement of the road infrastructure), a method is provided, that makes it possible to compare many diverse scenarios, featuring technological changes, societal changes or changes in the road network, all within the same framework. The ﬁndings suggest that one of the most promising strategies to decrease urban {CO}2 emissions is to focus on the use of electric cars, especially if it is combined with offering alternatives to private car trafﬁc and incentives for telecommuting. Banning the use of old cars only yields a signiﬁcant result if a large amount of cars is affected, which would make such a policy difﬁcult to implement. Expanding the road network has no signiﬁcant positive effect and may even encourage using cars, therefore leading to even more {CO}2 emissions. Due to its ﬂexible structure the presented model can be used to evaluate policies beyond what is presented in this study. It can easily be adapted to other conditions and geographical regions.},

Extensive work has been completed in the literature to develop efficient traffic assignment algorithms in order to reduce traffic congestion. While some of these algorithms have proven to be effective, little attention has been paid to the matter of scalability in traffic networks. In this paper, we use zones to develop a hybrid approach to traffic assignment. We divide a traffic network into zones where the path within each zone is proactively stored, and paths between zones are reactively evaluated. This reduces the cost of route discovery. Using the Simulator of Urban {MObility} ({SUMO}), experiments were conducted to compare the zone-based system coined Z-{BAR} against a zone-free system. Between Z-{BAR} and a zone-free system, initial results showed Z-{BAR} introduces a speedup factor of up to 1.22.},

In that context, new {ITS} paradigms like Cooperative Systems (C-{ITS}) enable an efﬁcient trafﬁc state estimation and trafﬁc control. C-{ITS} refers to three levels of cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure: (i) equipped vehicles with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ({ADAS}) adjusting their motion to surrounding trafﬁc conditions; (ii) information exchange with the infrastructure; (iii) vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Therefore, C-{ITS} makes it possible to go a step further in providing real time information and tailored control strategies to speciﬁc drivers. As a response to an expected increasing penetration rate of these systems, trafﬁc managers and researchers have to come up with new methodologies that override the classic methods of trafﬁc modeling and control. In this paper, we discuss some potentialities of C-{ITS} for trafﬁc management with the methodological issues following the expansion of such systems. Cooperative trafﬁc models are introduced into an open-source trafﬁc simulator. The resulting simulation framework is robust and able to assess potential beneﬁts of cooperative trafﬁc control strategies in different trafﬁc conﬁgurations.},

Recent additions to public clouds to support connected devices and {IoT} have the potential to similarly disrupt emerging homegrown and/or proprietary approaches. While early public cloud {IoT} success stories have focused on smaller-scale scenarios such as connected houses, it is unclear to what extent these new public cloud mechanisms and abstractions are suitable and eﬀective for larger-scale and/or scientiﬁc scenarios, which often have a diﬀerent set of constraints or requirements. In this paper, the design and implementation of a representative cloud-based {IoT} infrastructure in a speciﬁc public cloud – {AWS} – is presented. The system created is for dynamic vehicle traﬃc control based on vehicle volumes/patterns and public transport punctuality.

In this paper, we present a new architecture for modular microsimulation of urban land use, travel demand, and traﬃc assignment. {UrbanSim} is an open-source microsimulation platform used by metropolitan planning organizations worldwide for modeling the growth and development of cities over long (∼30 year) time horizons. {ActivitySim} is an agent-based modeling platform that produces synthetic origin–destination travel demand data, developed from the {UrbanSim} model and software framework. For traﬃc assignment, we have integrated two approaches. The ﬁrst is a static user equilibrium approach that is used as a benchmark. The second is a traﬃc microsimulation approach that we have highly parallelized to run on a {GPU} in order to enable full-model microsimulation of agents through the entire modeling workﬂow.

The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate a scenario able to meet all the basic requirements in terms of size, realism, and duration, in order to have a common basis for evaluations. In the interest of building a realistic scenario, we used information from a real city with a typical topology common in mid-size European cities, and realistic traffic demand and mobility patterns.

	abstract = {The emerging usage of connected vehicles promises new business models and a high level of innovation, but also poses new challenges for the automotive domain and in particular for the connectivity dimension, i. e. the connection between vehicles and cloud environments including the architecture of such systems. Among other challenges, {IoT} Cloud platforms and their services have to scale with the number of vehicles on the road to provide functionality in a reliable way, especially when dealing with safety-related functions. Testing the scalability, functionality, and availability of {IoT} Cloud platform architectures for connected vehicles requires data from real world scenarios instead of hypothetical data sets to ensure both the proper functionality of distinct connected vehicle services and that the architecture scales with a varying number of vehicles. However, the closed and proprietary nature of current connected vehicle solutions aggravate the availability of both vehicle data and test environments to evaluate diﬀerent architectures and cloud solutions. Thus, this paper introduces an approach for connecting the Eclipse {SUMO} traﬃc simulation with the open source connected vehicle ecosystem Eclipse Kuksa. More precisely, Eclipse {SUMO} is used to simulate traﬃc scenarios including microscopic properties like the position or emission. The generated data of each vehicle is then be sent to the message gateway of the Kuksa {IoT} Cloud platform and delegated to an according example service that consumes the data. In this way, not only the scalability of connected vehicle {IoT} architectures can be tested based on real world scenarios, but also the functionality of cloud services can be ensured by providing context-speciﬁc automotive data that goes beyond rudimentary or fake data-sets.},

Hence, for enhancing the power of Intelligent Transport Systems in automotive telematics, in this study, we used crowdsourced trafﬁc congestion data from Google to adjust trafﬁc light cycle times with a system that is adaptable to congestion. One aim of the system proposed here is to inform drivers about the status of the upcoming trafﬁc light on their route. Since crowdsourced data are used, the system does not entail the high infrastructure cost associated with sensing networks. A full system module-level analysis is presented for implementation. The system proposed is fail-safe against temporal communication failure. Along with a case study for examining congestion levels, generic information processing for the cycle time decision and status delivery system was tested and conﬁrmed to be viable and quick for a restricted prototype model. The information required was delivered correctly over sustained trials, with an average time delay of 1.5 s and a maximum of 3 s.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of vehicles has increased faster than the available infrastructure. Consequently, trafﬁc congestion has become a daily problem affecting several aspects of modern society, including regional economic development. In this way, Trafﬁc Management System ({TMS}) have been proposed to improve the trafﬁc efﬁcient and minimize trafﬁc congestion problems. These systems rely on gather trafﬁc-related data in a central entity to identify congestion and suggest alternative routes. However such approach adds load in communication channel depending on the trafﬁc density. In this way, this paper introduces {FASTER}, a fullydistributed {TMS} to improve the overall vehicle trafﬁc efﬁciency that does not overloads the communication channel, providing a suitable distributed solution. Simulation results indicate that our {FASTER} outperforms the assessed solutions in different scenarios and in different key requirements of {TMS}.},

	abstract = {In-vehicle applications that are based on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication technologies need to be evaluated under lab-controlled conditions before performing ﬁeld tests. The need for a tailored platform to perform speciﬁc research on the cooperative Advanced Driving Assistance System ({ADAS}) to assess the effect on driver behavior and driving performance motivated the development of a driver-centric trafﬁc simulator that is built over a 3D graphics engine. The engine creates a driving situation as it communicates with a trafﬁc simulator as a means to simulate real-life trafﬁc scenarios. The {TraCI} as a Service ({TraaS}) library was implemented to perform the interaction between the driver-controlled vehicle and the Simulation of Urban {MObility} ({SUMO}). An extension of a previous version, this work improves simulation performance and realism by reducing computational demand and integrating a tailored scenario with the {ADAS} to be tested. The usability of the implemented simulation platform was evaluated by means of an experiment related to the efﬁciency of a Trafﬁc Light Assistant ({TLA}), showing the analysis of the answer that 80\% of the participants were satisﬁed with the simulator and the {TLA} system implemented.},
